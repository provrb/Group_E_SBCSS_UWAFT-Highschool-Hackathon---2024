# UWAFT-Highschool-Hackathon-2024
This repository is the code submitted to UWAFT Hackathon 2024. THis project was created in under 5 hours and is extremely incomplete.
There were plans to add data saving and to actually finish the app, by integrating C++ for backend and using Python for the frontend.

The front end is created by https://github.com/Anonymous271828
Back end is created by me.
